ANAGRAM SOLVER

Anagram is a program which finds anagrams, written in Java and licensed under
the 3-clause BSD license. You can find license details in the LICENSE file,
which is located inside the root directory of the source distribution.

This is just a little anagram solver I coded for fun after having a hard time
guessing poorly drawn images on a game for mobile phones. It can be used to
find solutions for many popular games which involve finding words from a
scrambled set of letters.

The program allows the user to input a set of letters, and a desired length
for output words. Alternatively, the user may choose to use all the letters
in the word, can can enable a "Scrabble Mode" that will also find words shorter
than the specified length, and order the words by score.

DICTIONARIES

The anagram solver comes with two built-in dictionaries, which can be switched
from the program's "Dictionary" menu. The menu also allows loading external
dictionary files.

External dictionaries are expected to be text files with a single word per
line, and words in the file are expected to contain only lowercase, alphabetic
letters, with no spaces, punctuation or numbers.

COMPILATION

Building the anagram solver is simple. You will need Apache's Ant build system,
and a minimum JDK version of 1.5.

To compile, simply navigate to the root directory of the solver, and enter the
command:

   $ ant

This will produce a jar file, titled "Anagram.jar", as the output. This jar can
be run by the usual methods; double-clicking the file if you're on Windows or
Mac, or using the command:

   $ java -jar Anagram.jar

If you're on UNIX or Linux.

INSTALLATION

The jar file generated by Ant is entirely self-contained, so you can feel free
to copy it anywhere you'd like.
